# Getting Started

Clone the repo, and install Vagrant.

Vagrant creates virtual environments directly on your machine,
which makes it a lot easier to simulate live and production servers.

`curl -o vagrant.dmg https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.8.6/vagrant_1.8.6.dmg`

After Vagrant installs, cd into the project directory and boot Vagrant.

```cd korgapp
vagrant up```
